#Operator Precedence

Bitwise right shift has a lower precedence than subtraction, and we need to calculate the subtraction first.
The calculation above reads 8 >> 2 = 2

More explanation:
The >> operator moves each bit the specified number of times to the right. Empty holes at the left are filled with 0's.

If you move each bit 2 times to the right, 8 becomes 2:
 8 = 0000000000001000
becomes
 2 = 0000000000000010
