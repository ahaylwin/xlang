#Output Variables

#output one variable
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

#output multiple variables , separated by a comma
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

#You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

#For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)


#In the print() function, error when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator.
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)

#The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
