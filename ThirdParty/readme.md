### yaml-cpp (XLang Foundation Fork)

`yaml-cpp` is a YAML parser and emitter in C++, designed to handle YAML 1.2. This fork from the [main yaml-cpp repository](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) has been modified and integrated into the XLang Foundation's codebase. Unused files have been discarded to streamline integration into the `third-party/yaml-cpp` folder of XLang.

While this version contains modifications, it retains the core functionality and licensing terms of the original `yaml-cpp` project, ensuring compliance with the original license.
